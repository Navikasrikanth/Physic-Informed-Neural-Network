# Physics-Informed-Neural-Network
A PyTorch-based PINN that solves PDEs by embedding physical laws into the learning process. Demonstrates the 2D Poisson equation with automatic differentiation and boundary condition enforcement, showing how neural networks can learn physics-consistent solutions from minimal data.
