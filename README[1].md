# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
---
A PyTorch-based PINN that solves PDEs by embedding physical laws into the learning process. Demonstrates the 2D Poisson equation with automatic differentiation and boundary condition enforcement, showing how neural networks can learn physics-consistent solutions from minimal data.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository 

You can download the repository in one of two ways:

**1) Directly from GitHub**
- Click the green **Code** button → select **Download ZIP**
- Extract it to your preferred folder.

**2) Using Git (recommended)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Navikasrikanth/Physic-Informed-Neural-Network.git
cd <your-repo-name>
```

### 2. Install Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Then install the dependencies listed in ```requirements.txt```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Open the Notebook

You can use any of these methods:

**1) Jupyter Notebook**
- Then open the notebook file

**2) VS Code / JupyterLab**
- Open the ```.ipynb``` file directly and run cells interactively.

**3) Google Colab**
- Upload the notebook and run it in Colab.
- (Tip: You can use “Open in Colab” badge linking to this repo if you want.)


### 4. Run the Notebook

Run all cells **sequentially** from top to bottom:

**In Jupyter:**

> `Kernel` → `Restart & Run All`

**In Colab:**

> `Runtime` → `Run all`
